# FraudScope

Here’s a sample `README.md` section you can include in your GitHub repository for your fraud call detection system, FraudScope :


 📞 FraudScope – Fraud Call Detection System

FraudScope is a Machine Learning-based project aimed at detecting fraudulent phone calls using data analysis and visualization techniques. This system helps identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity, making it easier to prevent scams and protect users.

 🧠 Project Objective

The main goal of FraudScope is to:

* Build a predictive model to classify fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent calls.
* Analyze data to uncover hidden trends.
* Visualize important aspects of the dataset using various plots.

 📊 Data Visualization

FraudScope includes four key types of visualizations to better understand the data:

1. 📍 Scatter Plot
   Visualizes the relationship between features to identify patterns and clusters in call behavior.

2. 🔥 Heat Map
   Displays the correlation between numerical variables to show how features interact with each other.

3. 📊 Histogram
   Provides the distribution of a single feature (e.g., call duration, frequency) to spot unusual patterns.

4. 📈 Bar Chart
   Highlights categorical data like the count of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent calls.

 ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FraudScope.git
   cd FraudScope
   ```
2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run `fraudscope_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE.

 📝 Results

* Accurate classification of fraudulent calls using ML models.
* Clear and interactive visualizations to support decision-making.
* Insights into which features contribute most to fraud detection.
